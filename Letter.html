    <h2>My Dear Jiggasha</h2>
    <p>I could write a thousand letters, but none of them would ever be enough to fully express how special you are to me. Today, I want to take a moment to admire the most amazing, beautiful, and adorable person that has ever walked into my life. First, let me just say, why do you look so beautiful? Every time I see you, I'm mesmerized by your beauty, and it's not just on the outside. It's your heart, your kindness, your spirit and I'm so lucky that I get to call you mine. And yes, even when you’re angry, you’re still cute! I absolutely love the way you get annoyed at my jokes (Hehe) it's just so adorable! And when you mumble in your language, even though I can’t always understand it, but that’s just one of the countless things I love about you. You're the cutest, loveliest, kindest, most amazing person I’ve ever met. I also have to say, your yapping is my favorite, and that laugh of yours—oh my God (HÆhAHahA), and those golu molu cheeks — I could just nom nom them all day! I love everything about you—your eyes, your cute little baby lips, your hairs, those beautiful earrings you wear, your smol fingers, you’re chubby in all the right ways, and even how you’re just so perfectly you. <b>Jiggasha</b>, you are my biggest supporter, you're my happiness, my joy and my forever love. I love that you're always so optimistic and positive, even when life gets tough. You have such a pure heart, and you’re always there for me when I need you. You’re never far from my thoughts, even when we’re apart. <b>Happy Birthday</b>, my love. I love you more than words could ever say, and I’ll keep loving you more every single day. Thank you for being you, for being my everything. So, on this special day, I want to ask you something. Will you always be by my side, holding my hand through life’s ups and downs?</p>
